# proxmoxve Provider

Use the ProxmoxVE provider to manage Proxmox Virtual Environment configuration, reasources, virtual machines etc. on a compatible PMVE cluster or standalone server. You must configure the provider with API credentials before using it.<p />The following environment variables can be set as a fallback for any omitted attributes in the provider declaration: `PROXMOXVE_BASE_URL`, `PROXMOXVE_TOKEN_ID`, `PROXMOXVE_SECRET`, `PROXMOXVE_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `PROXMOXVE_TOTPSEED`, `PROXMOXVE_TLS_INSECURE`.<p />**NOTE:** `base_url` attribute is always required. Additionally, most API endpoints require `token_id` and `secret`. Other API endpoints require `root_password`, and if 2FA is enabled for the `root` user, `totp_seed` must also be informed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    proxmoxve = {
      source = "c10l/proxmoxve"
    }
  }
}

provider "proxmoxve" {
  base_url      = "https://pmve.example.com:8006"
  token_id      = "apiuser@pam!proxmoxve_terraform_token"
  secret        = "token_secret"
  root_password = "password"
  totp_seed     = "<generated by Proxmox VE when enabling 2FA>"
  tls_insecure  = false
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `base_url` (String) Base URL of the Proxmox VE API server. e.g. https://pmve.example.com:8006
- `root_password` (String, Sensitive) Password of the `root` user. Some API endpoints can only be called via a ticket which must be acquired as the `root@pam` user (as opposed to an API token). e.g. the ACME endpoits
- `secret` (String, Sensitive) API Token secret
- `tls_insecure` (Boolean) Set to `true` to bypass TLS cert validation. Defaults to `false`
- `token_id` (String) API token ID. e.g. `user@pam!token_name`
- `totp_seed` (String, Sensitive) If the `root` user has 2FA enabled, please inform the seed used to generate the OTPs. At the moment no other methods of 2FA are supported.
